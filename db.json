      "description": "The Blues loanee faces an uncertain future despite being sure of his personal preference. Mateo Kovacic remains in limbo over his future but the player himself wants to stay at Chelsea, even after Zinedine Zidane returned to the Real Madrid dugout, Goal understands.The on-loan star has had no assurances from the Blues hierarchy and a variety of issues need to be resolved before the Croatia international can be signed on a permanent deal. Kovacic has made 41 appearances, without scoring, since arriving at Stamford Bridge on a season-long loan deal from Madrid last August.",

France and Paris Saint-Germain star Kylian Mbappe is happy to be behind Pele in the World Cup record books. Mbappe, then 19, became the second youngest player to score in a World Cup final when he struck in France's win over Croatia in last year's decider. Pele is the youngest and the pair are the only teenagers to have netted in a decider at the showpiece tournament.",

Ole Gunnar Solskjaer praised Manchester United's performance in a 2-1 defeat at Wolves that dents their Champions League qualification hopes but conceded his team made preventable errors. Scott McTominay's first goal for the club put United in front at Molineux, where a victory would have seen Solskjaer's side jump above Arsenal and Tottenham into third in the Premier League. But Diogo Jota levelled after Fred gave away possession and United captain Ashley Young was sent off after being booked twice for fouls on the Wolves striker to become the 100th dismissal of Mike Dean's Premier League career.",

Declan Rice is choosing to ignore speculation suggesting that his performances for West Ham have attracted interest from Manchester rivals City and United. The 20-year-old has enjoyed a stunning rise to prominence in the 2018-19 campaign. A positional shift which has moved him out of a defensive berth and into a holding midfield role has given the youngster a new lease of life.",
